              <p>
                Welcome to the home on the Web for Hairstrike: the 80s metal phenomenon.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's music from a simpler time, when women were cool, and men were hot. And guitars had a lot of sustain. That's right: spandex, Aquanet, shredding guitars and shrieking vocals. This is party music, for "nothing but a good time."</a>
