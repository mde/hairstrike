              <p>
		Jake Viceroy grew up on a pig farm in Laredo, Texas, where
		hog-calling helped him to perfect the traditional high-pitch
		metal shriek.
			  </p>

              <p>
    He feasted on a steady diet of metal all through
		school, studying in detail the genius of performers like Ronnie
		James Dio, Paul Stanley, Klaus Meine, Rob Halford, and of course
		Jani Lane, and eventually deciding to devote his life to the
		pursuit of metal awesome, for its purity as an art-form, and "for
		the chicks."
			  </p>

              <p>
    He has never had it officially measured, but has a vocal-range of "about 18
    octaves." Whether it's the raspy/creepy Stephen Pearcy; the over-dramatic
    Dokken; the super-shrieky Sebastian Bach, or the soaring, OMFG-pretty Steve
    Perry; Jake has studied it, and mastered it all.
				</p>

              <p>
    Jake picked up the guitar in college to increase his
    skill in metal bad-assery, and mostly sticks to playing his late-80s Les
    Paul, "because it's a f*cking Les Paul."

              <h3>j.c.&nbsp;sleet</h3>
              <p class="band-bio-subtitle">Lead guitar, backup vocal</p>
              <p>
		J.C. started playing guitar when he was eight years old, at the
		feet of his grandfather, Randall "Fuzzy" Winston, one of the
		great country-western songwriters of our time. J.C. soon after
		discovered metal, and the legend was born.
	      </p>

              <p>
		J.C. studied all the greats: Jimmy Page, George Lynch, Yngwie J.
		Malmsteen, and that guy from Nitro. Once J.C. had mastered the
		true Zen of shredding, he decided to bring it to a broader
		audience, forming Hairstrike as a way to bring this
		teaching to the masses. When the volume on his amp reaches the
		right amplitude, rifts sometimes open in spacetime, because,
		"science." </p>

              <p>
    Don't ever ask J.C. about 'das blikenlights' -- there are too many ever to
    be explained, and the hours of wasted talking could be better spent f*cking
    shredding. Also, who wants to run the very real risk of weaponization?
	      </p>

              <p>
    There is one strange and yet inescapable fact of J.C.'s life that has
    followed him in his career as a guitarist, and in his life in general: you
    can't spell 'Sleet' without 'leet.'

              <p>
		Cole Stone is a stone-cold badass. He hails from Newport News,
		Virginia, and built his first bass from two-by-fours and
		chicken-wire when he was seven years old. Cole's strange,
		preternatural gift for harmony-singing emerged shortly after
		that, when he accidentally broke all the windows in the house
		while part-singing in the ultrasonic range with the family dog.
	      </p>

              <p>
    He heard his first metal track on local FM radio, and after seeing the
    leering, sneering faces on MTV's "Headbanger's Ball," he realized it was his
    destiny to be a metal star as well.
	      </p>

              <p>
    Cole is the strong, silent type -- he wears his stoicism on his sleeve like
    some men wear their feelings. Feelings are not important -- f*cking metal is
    what's important. He may appear to be standing like heavy stone, bou can bet
    your ass that Cole is gathering his 'ki' to bring the bass and vocal attack
    that flattens the crowd.
