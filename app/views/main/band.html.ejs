              <p class="band-bio-subtitle">Lead vocal, rhythm guitar</p>
              <p>
		Jake Viceroy grew up on a pig farm in Laredo, Texas, where
		hog-calling helped him to perfect the traditional high-pitch
		metal shriek.
			  </p>

              <p>
    He feasted on a steady diet of metal all through
		school, studying in detail the genius of performers like Ronnie
		James Dio, Klaus Meine, Paul Stanley, Rob Halford, and of course
		Jani Lane, and eventually deciding to devote his life to the
		pursuit of metal awesome, for its purity as an art-form, and "for
		the chicks."
			  </p>

              <p>
    He has never had it officially measured, but has a vocal-range of "about 18
    octaves," and his versatility is peerless -- whether it's the raspy/creepy
    Stephen Pearcy; the over-dramatic Dokken; the super-shrieky Sebastian Bach,
    or the soaring, OMFG-pretty Steve Perry; Jake can do it all.
				</p>

              <p>
    Jake picked up the guitar in college to increase his
    skill in metal bad-assery, and mostly sticks to playing his late-80s Les
    Paul, "because it's a fucking Les Paul."

              <h3>j.c. sleet</h3>
              <p class="band-bio-subtitle">Lead guitar, backup vocal</p>
              <p>
		J.C. started playing guitar when he was eight years old, at the
		feet of his grandfather, Randall "Fuzzy" Winston, one of the
		great country-western songwriters of our time. J.C. soon after
		discovered metal, and the legend was born.
	      </p>

              <p>
		J.C. studied all the greats: Jimmy Page, George Lynch, Yngwie J.
		Malmsteen, and that guy from Nitro. Once J.C. had mastered the
		true Zen of shredding, he decided to bring it to a broader
		audience, forming Hairstrike as a way to bring metal truth to
		the masses. When the volume on his amp reaches the right
		amplitude, rifts sometimes open in spacetime, because,
		"science." </p>

              <p>
    Don't ever ask J.C. about 'das blikenlights' -- there are too many ever to
    be explained, and the hours of wasted talking could be better spent fucking
    shredding. Also, who wants to run the very real risk of weaponization?
	      </p>

              <p>
    There is one strange and yet inescapable fact of J.C.'s life that has
    followed him in his career as a guitarist, and in his life in general: you
    can't spell 'Sleet' without 'leet.'

              <p class="band-bio-subtitle">Bass guitar, backup vocal</p>
              <p>
		Cole Stone is a stone-cold badass. He hails from Newport News,
		Virginia, and built his first bass from two-by-fours and
		chicken-wire when he was seven years old. Cole's strange,
		preternatural gift for harmony-singing emerged shortly after
		that, when he accidentally broke all the windows in the house
		while part-singing in the ultrasonic range with the family dog.
	      </p>

              <p>
    He heard his first metal track on local FM radio, and after seeing the
    leering, sneering faces on MTV's "Headbanger's Ball," he realized it was his
    destiny to be a metal star as well.
	      </p>

              <p>
    Cole is the strong, silent type -- he wears his stoicism on his sleeve like
    some men wear their feelings. Feelings are not important -- fucking metal is
    what's important. No matter where he is or what he's doing, you can bet your
    ass that Cole is gathering his 'ki' for some metal bass-and-vocal
    bad-assery.

              <p class="band-bio-subtitle">Drums</p>
              <p>
		Bones Diablo grew up in Papua, New Guinea, the son of
		missionaries. He learned the native kundu drum at an early age,
		and proved to be a prodigy, until the fateful day he heard a
		Stryper record brought along by a fellow missionary. This proved
		a metal gateway drug, and soon Bones was honing his skills
		playing to the true metal gospels like Led Zeppelin and Motley
		Crue.
	      </p>

              <p>
    He an unerring sense of time, down to the micro-milli-kajilli-second, and a
    finely discriminating sense of feel.  Bones always knows whether to hold
    back with some minimal time-keeping, or to "Neil Peart the shit out of it."
    Either way, Bones's playing is bombastic, fantastic, and metal as fuck.
	      </p>

              <p>
    Bones is generally shy and retiring, a "fuckin' sensitive" soul. It's
    practically impossible to get him to open up, but when he does, the results
    can be beautiful and profound. Drumming provides an avenue to express this
    inner beauty -- the metal world can be greatful for that.  When Bones is in
    the groove, he can't be stopped, and John Bonham help the man who gets in
    his way.
